# recycle
cycle-restart built from the ground up for xstream

This turned out to be just an experiment. I went into it thinking I could avoid all of the nastiness of the cycle-restart codebase, and then it turned out I did it all for a reason.

cycle-restart now supports xstream and modern cycle.js, go check it out instead.
